## Introduction 

 When you go to the supermarket, usually the first thing you do is grab a shopping cart. As you move up and down the aisles, you will pick up certain items and place them in your shopping cart. Most of these items may correspond to a shopping list that was prepared ahead of time, but other items may have been selected spontaneously.

•	We will be analyzing how to convert the consumer tastes and preferences into Association rules that are more insightful and actionable,from business perspective.
